#Details for teaching team
I wanted to make/use a calendar gui for this project, but I'm not very good with js/jquery. I also tried to use the propaganistas/laravel-phone package, but it required the international extension and was throwing off composer. I also couldn't figure out how to populate the input fields when moving into the edit page.


#Outside code
Some snipits are based off of code from lecture (debugging routes, environment.php, login/logout routes).
